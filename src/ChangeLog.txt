Version 1.4.0 - 13/Dec/2014

    ':.*' after the name (phenixia2003)

Version 1.0rc1 - 16/Oct/2013
  - Slackware 14.1 is coming up. I think that also slackpkg+ is ready so as
    Slackware I mark it as rc1 :). slackpkg 2.82.0-11 added the 14.1 repositories.
    Unfortuatly I don't know which third-party repository will contains 14.1 
    packages, so I can't add 14.1 to repositories.txt
